# Real-estate-Statistical-modelling-using-R

Price of a property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers . Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.

I shall be using two datasets , housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv . 
I shall use data housing_train to build predictive model for response variable "Price". 
Housing_test data contains all other factors except "Price" - I shall predict its value by using statistical modelling technique. But the Predictions should not contain NA values

Score will be calculated as:

Score =212467/RMSE 
Where RMSE is root mean square error on test file.
